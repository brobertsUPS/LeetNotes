* Searching - Binary search
* AI - Minimax

2. Data Structures
* Abstract - Stack, Queue
* Linear - Array, Resizing array, linked list
* Trees - Binary, B-trees, Heaps, Tries, Self balancing
* Hashes
* Graphs - Cycle detection, Coloring, Representations

3. Practice Problems
* 2nd largest item in a BST
* etc...

4. Language Specific
